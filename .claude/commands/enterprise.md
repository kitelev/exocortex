3. **Quality gate validation** with automated testing
4. **TodoWrite integration** for progress tracking
5. **Production deliverables** with comprehensive reporting

### 🎯 PHASE 0: MANDATORY BDD EXECUTABLE SPECIFICATIONS

**🚨 CRITICAL: ALL CODE CHANGES REQUIRE BDD SCENARIOS FIRST**

This phase is **MANDATORY** and **BLOCKING** - no code can be written without completing executable specifications.

#### Stage 0.1: BDD Scenario Development

**Deploy Senior BDD Specialist (20+ years experience):**

```yaml
Senior_BDD_Specialist:
  agent: qa-engineer
  experience_level: senior_20_years
  certifications: [ISTQB-ATAE, CBAP, Cucumber-Certified]
  
  executable_specifications:
    gherkin_syntax:
      - Feature: High-level business capability
      - Scenario: Specific behavior example
      - Given: Initial context/state
      - When: Action/event that triggers behavior
      - Then: Expected outcome/result
      - And/But: Additional conditions

  exocortex_plugin_examples:
    rdf_triple_management:
      feature: |
        Feature: RDF Triple Management
          As a knowledge worker
          I want to manage RDF triples in my vault
          So that I can build a semantic knowledge graph
        
        Scenario: Adding a valid RDF triple
          Given I have an empty RDF graph
          When I add a triple with subject "ex:Person1", predicate "ex:hasName", and object "John Doe"
          Then the triple should be stored in the graph
          And the graph should contain exactly 1 triple
          And I should be able to query for the triple
        
        Scenario: Rejecting invalid RDF triple
          Given I have an RDF graph
          When I attempt to add a triple with invalid IRI format
          Then the system should reject the triple
          And display an appropriate error message
          And the graph should remain unchanged
        
        Scenario: Querying RDF triples by subject
          Given I have a graph with 5 triples for subject "ex:Person1"
          And I have 3 triples for subject "ex:Person2"
          When I query for all triples with subject "ex:Person1"
          Then I should receive exactly 5 triples
          And all returned triples should have "ex:Person1" as subject
    
    obsidian_integration:
      feature: |
        Feature: Obsidian Vault Integration
          As an Obsidian user
          I want the plugin to automatically extract semantic data from my notes
          So that my knowledge graph reflects my vault content
        
        Scenario: Processing new note with semantic content
          Given I have an empty vault
          When I create a note with YAML frontmatter containing "type: Person"
          And the note content contains "[[John Doe]] works at [[Acme Corp]]"
          Then the system should extract 2 entities
          And create appropriate RDF triples for the relationships
          And the knowledge graph should be updated automatically
        
        Scenario: Handling note deletion
          Given I have a note that contributed 3 triples to the graph
          When I delete the note
          Then the 3 triples should be removed from the graph
          And the graph statistics should be updated
          And no orphaned data should remain
    
    query_engine_abstraction:
      feature: |
        Feature: Query Engine Abstraction
          As a developer
          I want to use different query engines interchangeably
          So that the system can adapt to available technologies
        
        Scenario: Dataview engine availability
          Given Dataview plugin is installed and active
          When I initialize the query engine factory
          Then it should detect Dataview as available
          And create a DataviewQueryEngine instance
          And the engine should pass basic query tests
        
        Scenario: Fallback to native engine
          Given no query engine plugins are available
          When I initialize the query engine factory
          Then it should fall back to the native engine
          And the native engine should handle basic queries
          And maintain data consistency
    
    mobile_optimization:
      feature: |
        Feature: Mobile Performance Optimization
          As a mobile Obsidian user
          I want the plugin to work smoothly on my device
          So that I can access my knowledge graph anywhere
        
        Scenario: Touch gesture recognition
          Given I'm using Obsidian on a touch device
          When I perform a pinch gesture on the graph view
          Then the graph should zoom appropriately
          And the zoom should be smooth and responsive
          And zoom limits should be respected
        
        Scenario: Adaptive batch processing
          Given I'm on a mobile device with limited resources
          When the system processes a large number of notes
          Then it should use smaller batch sizes
          And show progress indicators
          And maintain UI responsiveness

│   Given the user "john.doe@company.com" exists in the system   │
│   When the user attempts to login with correct password        │
│   Then the user should be successfully authenticated           │
│   And a JWT token should be generated                          │
│   And the session should be established                        │

│   Given MFA is enabled for user "admin@company.com"           │
│   When the user provides valid username and password          │
│   Then the system should request MFA verification             │

│   Then the account should be locked for 30 minutes            │
│   And a security alert should be triggered                    │
│   And the attempt should be logged for audit                  │
│                                                                 │
│ Scenario: SSO integration with enterprise directory           │
│   Given the user exists in Active Directory                   │
│   When they access the system via SSO provider                │
│   Then authentication should be delegated to AD               │
│   And user roles should be synchronized                       │
